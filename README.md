# EZShop
EZShop is a team project developed during a "Software Engineering" course I took during my Computer Engineering Master Degree.  

EZShop was made for small shops that require a simple application to support the owner or manager. It is a software application to: 
1. Manage sales
2. Manage inventory 
3. Manage customers 
4. Support accounting
